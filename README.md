## About

Cecil has a wide variety of commands, from its main focus of moderation, to miscellaneous features that will help engage your community.

## Notes
* The bot's default prefix is `c!` but it can be changed with the command `c!prefix`.
* Many of the APIs used by Cecil require private keys to be issued before the commands that need them will work.
